## Setup:

connect the components as specified by the constants of the main.py file:

WORKER_LEDS -> GP17

PLANT_LEDS -> GP16

WORKER_BUTTON -> GP15

PLANT_BUTTON -> GP14

## Todo:

- [ ] Change the code to support a RGB LED for the worker lights instead of a standard LED
- [ ] Develop procedure to measure the light intensity as for the handout
- [ ] Develop procedure to measure the soil moisture as for the handout
- [ ] calculate resistor values
- [ ] cover CAD
